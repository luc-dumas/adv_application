# Adventure Routes
The idea behind this project was to build an application where users could track adventure motorcycling routes that they had rode on.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind
This project was built with React and heavily stylized with Tailwind. The project cemented the concept of props and components

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to effectively pass props through different components. Additionally, I learned how to organize a React application - understanding when and where to use components. The application is not finished as there is no backend; however I hope to finish the project soon.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
